You might need to install some of these before running the game:

  Python:     http://www.python.org/

  Cocos2D:    http://www.python.cocos2d.org/



RUNNING THE GAME:

On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "run_game.pyw" file and double-click it.

Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and run:

  python run_game.py



HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

  Use the WASD or arrow keys to control the player.
  Use the space bar to shoot and control the bullet in flight with W and A keys
    or the UP and DOWN arrow keys.
  (When you shoot, everything but your bullet freezes)
  (Tip: when a Badputer shoots at you, try to hit its bullet with your own)
  (Warning: there is some type of bug with the barricade blocks (yellow with
    black stripes), don't WALK too close to it (you can jump all over and around
    it, just don't WALK up to it to touch it) :P)
  You have to kill atleast ~2/3 of enemies to be able to go through the
    blue teleporter.
  Once you have killed the correct number of enemies, find the blue teleporter
    and touch it.
